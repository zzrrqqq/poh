        <h2>AI and Copyright</h2>
        <p>
          Greg Rutkowski, the artist famous for his fantasy scenes, is among the most 
          welcomed artists in Stable Diffusion, the famous AI art generator. His name 
          was used 90000 times to represent his art style within the prompts of generative AI
           But the artist himself had never noticed and consent to the "citation".

        <p>
          <br>He is not alone. Problems about copyright and responsibility in generative AI keeps on arising, which mainly focus on two categories:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Who should be responsible for the problems happening in AI-generated art?</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          The problem is quite tricky as nobody can fully understand how algorithms and machine learning works, even their creators. Thus, it's hard to attribute
          to a certain group of people or an organization. Regulation and new laws can be effective, but it takes too much time.
          <br>
          The most ideal way for AI artists is "create their own datasets, curate images from the public domain, or ask for consent of those in a dataset, calculate the environmental costs of training, and document their work with explainable AI fields." (Leibowicz 195) It's nearly impossible nowadays as only a few artists can manage such high standard technology and resource. Nevertheless, the ultimate solution still provides some insights in tackling with the problem nowadays. Artists can check the status of the image or art style they may refer to when using AI to avoid copyright and consent controversies. Also, they can use certain ways of documentation to find a better explanation in case problems like bias occur. This may help the development of AI as well. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Who owns the copyrights of the generated art?</strong>
          <br><br>
          In most cases, where AI is used as a tool in creating an image, and the outcome is somehow predictable, the person who is using the AI owns the copyright to it, according to literature and researches studying copyright laws in the US (US laws is selected as reference because it's relatively complete). On the other hand. When the image is totally randomly generated according to the task assigned, and the output is thereby unpredictable, the copyright of the generated images will fall into public domain. (Hristov 435)
