        <h2>Why should Artists Embrace AI-based Art</h2>
        <h1>Central Claim</h1>
        <p1><strong>"Even though there exist ethical problems with AI-based art, such as bias, job loss, 
          and unclear copyright and responsibility, we should still embrace AI-based art as it is not only
           a suitable way to explore the technology and solve these problems, but also because it will create 
           a new perspective of art."</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
        </p1>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Generative AI has been a hit these years. Using the technology in areas like business
          and marketing is widely accepted. However, when it comes to art, especially
          fine art, things become much more controversial. Some artists consider AI as a scourge, 
          others criticize ethical problems twined with the deep-learning based tools, while the 
          rest holds a much more positive voice and are willing to embrace the technology
        </p>
        <h1>How Art Works</h1>
        <p><strong>"Engagement in art contributes to quality of life. Quality of life contributes to societyâ€™s 
          capacity to invent, create, and express itself. This capacity contributes back to art, both 
          directly and indirectly."</strong>(Iyengar 8)
          <br>
          <strong>"Our societal capacity to innovate and to express ideas can lead to support for arts infrastruc
            ture"</strong>(Iyengar 9)
          <br>
          Art is bounded with inventing, creating and expressing, it keeps on changing and absorbing new things 
          based on social changes.
        </p>

        <h1>Characteristics of AI</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Low Creativity</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          Human intelligence can be divided into analytical intelligence and Intuitive Intelligence. The latter, 
          which involves thinking and feeling is what art emphasize on. However, current 
          technology only enables analytic intelligence, intuitive intelligence is still too complex
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>High Productivity</strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          Mornet spent seven years in creating "The Great Water Lily", while generative AI only
          need 10 seconds to create a similar one with the same amount of details. By using this in creating
          drafts for art pieces, it will save the artists a lot of time and trial and error cost
        </p>
